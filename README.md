# calend-me
make me a little google calendar of events with blurbs containing information I should know.
what is information I should know? right now it's CS-related, but I am looking to expand into math things

how? options -
- given a CS textbook, calend-me should summarize sections
- given a wiki-style website like OSDev, calend-me should scrape pages recursively and summarize them
- topics will be pulled out of a txt file maybe. how to minimize manual labor?

calend-me should populate info events once a week, on sunday evenings. events are randomly picked from txt file

# to do
- decide how I want calend-me to get information and on what granularity
- explore google calendar api https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/guides/overview
- look into webscrapers - beautifulsoup
- look into summary AIs with an API and need to be free or else I give up

this used to be called me-mail but then I realized I do not check my email. it does not escape me that this project is called cal end me I thought that was funny
